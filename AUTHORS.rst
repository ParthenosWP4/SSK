The **Standardization Survival Kit** has been developed in the context of the PARTHENOS project.

The PARTHENOS project
---------------------

PARTHENOS stands for “Pooling Activities, Resources and Tools for Heritage E-research Networking, Optimization and Synergies”. It is a research infrastructure whose objective is to strengthen the cohesion of research across a number of related fields associated with the humanities. This broad sector includes linguistic studies, cultural heritage, history and archaeology and existing research structures such as ARIADNE (archaeology), CLARIN (languages) and DARIAH (arts and humanities) are members of PARTHENOS.

To know more about the partners please visit the dedicated page.

Within the PARTHENOS infrastructure,  the Work Package 4 (WP4) addressed the standards set up by community needs and defined, managed and maintained by international initiatives. The standards concern all the aspects of digital activity, from individual items to documents and collections.
