                    Archiving Reflectance Transformation Imaging Datasets

                    Reflectance Transformation Imaging, a computational photography method based on the principle of raking light, has been extensively used in fields such as archaeology, museum studies, and art history to capture and enhance subtle surface details. Low-angled and multidirectional light creates texture details and enhances planar irregularities. There are two methods to capture RTI images: the Dome Method and the Highlight RTI Method. In both methods, objects are photographed with a single camera in a fixed position. The only element that changes in the process is the position of light. In the Dome method the light position is known since lights are fixed. In the highlight method the position of the light is captured by using reflective spheres that are then used by a specialised software to create the RTI image. The images stack is then computed into a polynomial texture map. In a dedicated viewer, the resulting file can be viewed under individual light positions and different rendering algorithms.  This scenario focuses on the preparation of captured RTI data for archiving. The main component of an RTI dataset is photographies. Additionally some software-dependent formats will have to be considered for archiving.
