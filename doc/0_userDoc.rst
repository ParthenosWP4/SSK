The Standardization Survival Kit: presentation
==============================================

To support the digital evolution within Social Sciences and Humanities
research, it is necessary to stabilize knowledge on standards and
research good practices. The goal of the **Standardization Survival Kit
(SSK)**, developed within the `PARTHENOS project <http://parthenos-project.eu/>`_, is to accompany researchers
along this route, giving access to standards and best practices in a
meaningful way, by the mediation of research scenarios. A research
scenario is a (digital) workflow practiced by researchers, that can be
repeatedly applied to a task that will help to gain material or insights
in view of a research question. These scenarios are at the core of the
SSK, as they embed resources with contextual information and relevant
examples on standardized processes and methods in a research context.
The SSK is an open tool where users are able to publish new scenarios or
adapt existing ones. These scenarios can be seen as a living memory of
what should be the best research practices in a given community, made
accessible and reusable for other researchers.

Why standards after all?
------------------------

The main issue in defining a policy about standards is to understand
what they actually are. In the context of research, standards usually
take the form of documents informing about practices, protocols,
artefact characteristics or data formats that can be used as reference
for two parties working in the same field of activity to be able to
produce comparable (or interoperable) results. This will also foster
innovative, cross-disciplinary research paths, and eventually contribute
to bridge the gap between the different cultures that are represented in
the wide landscape of the Arts, Humanities and Cultural Heritage
studies.

Standards are usually published by standardization organisations (such
as ISO, W3C or the TEI Consortium) which ensure that the following three
requirements for standards are actually fulfilled:

-  Expression of a consensus: the standard should reflect the expertise
   of a wide (possibly international) group of experts in the field

-  Publication: the standard should be accessible to anyone who wants to
   know its content

-  Maintenance: the standard is updated, replaced or deprecated
   depending on the evolution of the corresponding technical field.

Standards are not regulations. There is no obligation to follow them for
research except when one actually wants to produce results that can be
compared with those of a wider community. This is why a standardization
policy for an infrastructure in the Arts and Humanities should include
recommendations as to what attitude the scholarly communities could or
should adopt with regard to specific standards.

The preceding characteristics outlined for standards put a strong
emphasis on the role of communities of practice and the corresponding
bodies that represent them. Ideally, a good standard reflects the work
of the relevant community and is maintained by the appropriate body.
This is exactly the case of the `Text Encoding Initiative <http://tei-c.org/>`_ with respect to
text representation standards and, to a lesser extent, of `EAD (Encoded Archival Description) <http://loc.gov/ead>`_, whose maintenance is
taken up by the `Library of Congress <http://loc.gov/>`_ with support
of the `Society of American Archivists <https://www2.archivists.org/>`_.

Because there is no obligation to use a given standard, it is essential
to provide potential users with:

1. awareness about the appropriate standards and the interest to adopt them,

2. the cognitive tools to help them identify the optimal use of
   standards through selection and possibly customization of a
   reference portfolio.

The experience gained within the various communities and infrastructure
represented in `PARTHENOS <http://parthenos-project.eu/>`__ that have
been in the need of adopting existing standards, is that there is always
an initial phase during which scholars should be made aware of some core
standards that are systematically related to the definition of
interoperable digital objects. This is basically what has lead us to
identify the notion of Standardization Survival Kit (SSK). In the table
below, for instance, we can see a first group of standards without which
it is more or less impossible to deal with digital content in a proper
way.

The concept of SSK goes far beyond these baseline examples and aims at
covering reference digital scenarios in the Arts and Humanities: a role
of the SSK is to help communities participate in standardization
activities where they exist, or at least document and spread the best
practices as de facto standardized guidelines. Such a strategy will also
contribute to the actual stabilization of existing conceptual and
technical knowledge within ongoing projects, and provide a channel for
the wider dissemination of the corresponding results.

The SSK: a toolkit for Humanities scholars
------------------------------------------

The work carried out by the SSK covers four types of activities
related to the deployment and use of standards in the Humanities and
Cultural Heritage fields:

-  **Documenting** existing standards to provide a reference for
   scholars who want to find out more about their role and content.
   This relates to the specific provision of bibliographic sources,
   available documentation, specific targeted introductions, as well
   as providing prototypical examples which can serve as models for
   similar work, possibly made available through focused Virtual
   Research Environments within the PARTHENOS infrastructure;

-  **Supporting** the actual adoption of standards by identifying how
   they relate to research scenarios and gathering the essential
   materials for controlling their deployment (e.g. schemas);

-  **Communicating** with research communities so that they can be made
   aware of both the need to apply standards in their digital
   scholarly practices but also be informed of the essential
   standards for their own fields.

-  **Training** for researchers, by giving them access to complete
   frameworks so that they may acquire knowledge and know-how on
   standardized methodologies.

In order to apply these four principles, the SSK focuses on giving
researchers access to standards in a meaningful way. That is why it is
built around research scenarios.

These scenarios are the core of the SSK because they aim at providing
**contextual information** and relevant **examples** on how standards
can be applied in a given research project. They potentially cover **all
the domains of the Humanities**, from Literature to Heritage science,
including History, Social sciences, Linguistics, etc.

They have been created and they are added to the SSK by domain experts,
from **real life researcher-oriented use cases)**, divided into
different steps, and involving specific tasks.

These scenarios can be seen as a living memory of what should be the
best research practices in a given community, made accessible and
reusable for other researchers wishing to carry out a similar project
but unfamiliar with the recommended tools, formats, methods to use, etc.
For that reason, the SSK can be considered as a **complete framework**
showing concrete use of standards, rather than simply a catalogue of
resources.

Design principles & features of the SSK
---------------------------------------

From the very start of the project, the aim has
been to build an **easy-to-use** online and collaborative platform with
a **user-friendly** design. The idea of having general, end-to-end
scenarios to help researchers carry out their project by following best
practices and clear methods in their area of expertise is the most
important design principle for the SSK.

The second principle is to add **context**: a “story-telling” approach
to the use of standards in the Humanities and Social Sciences. The goal
is to avoid providing yet another catalogue of resources, and offer
instead contextual, **activity-based information** on how to use
standards for researchers who are unfamiliar with them, but could see
how they are used and what workflow they help achieve by following a
scenario.

With these principles in mind, the SSK should enable the user, to
perform two main actions:

1. **Consult and follow the guidelines expressed in the scenarios** you
   are interested in for your project. Finding the most relevant ones
   should be easy since the navigation relies on strong taxonomies
   covering the different aspects of research: the disciplines, the
   type of techniques and objects involved, the concrete activities
   carried out, the standards needed.

2. **Propose new scenarios** of your own by following a predefined
   model, with the possibility of both adding new content (steps as
   well as resources) and reusing existing content (to avoid
   duplication if a general step is already available in another
   scenario).

The first feature is fully operational. It was tested for the first time
in April 2018, and iterations with test users have contributed to
improve the **information readability** and **attractiveness,** in
particular the exploration and search of scenarios.

The work on the second feature, allowing the user to contribute, is
still ongoing. It is possible to create research scenarios with the SSK
underlying data model, the Text Encoding Initiative, or TEI (see the
dedicated section for more information). However, as we are aware that
this solution requires some technical knowledge, a user-friendly
interface is currently under development and should be released during
the first trimester 2019.

Anyone who has registered and agreed to the “\ **Terms of use**\ ”
clearly stated will be able to contribute. This option has been chosen
due to the difficulties of setting up some kind of editorial board in
charge of reviewing any scenarios submitted. The **quality check** of
the contributions should come from the very strict model that has to be
followed in the scenario creation process. In addition, by contributing
to the SSK, the user accepts to be visible and citable as an author, to
be responsible for the work that he/she decides to share with others.

Why would you, as a researcher, want to contribute to the SSK? There are
three main reasons:

-  to make your research project align with the best practices in your
   community

-  to get peer review and visibility

-  to share a project in another form than the usual blog / article (a
   new way to disseminate your work).

SSK components: Scenarios < Steps < Resources
--------------------------------------------

The SSK is a web platform builded on three main layers nested within
each other following a specific order: Research scenarios, steps and
resources.

Each **scenario** within the SSK works like a high-level research guide
for scholars. They are made up of successive **steps** or tasks, and can
be followed as a complete process to solve a given problem with the most
standardized means. For each step, the appropriate **resources** to
perform the given task are proposed, divided into two categories: the
“\ **general resources**\ ” that include the primary documentation and
tools; and the “\ **project-specific resources**\ ” that point to
concrete use cases in which a similar task was accomplished. The
material contained in these sections is of various kinds:

-  The most important is the **state-of-the-art bibliography**, which
   includes all the documentation needed to carry out a given task.
   The bibliographical references are up-to-date and gathered within
   a `Zotero library <https://www.zotero.org/groups/427927/ssk-parthenos>`__,
   which was specially created for this project. This choice was made
   to ease the resource selection process and to allow for a
   collaborative watch and curation of relevant information. When the
   resource is available online, a direct link is provided;
   otherwise, the user is given all the necessary metadata.

-  The SSK also offers the possibility to point to more **technical
   resources**, such as stylesheets, code samples, software or
   services.

-  **Training materials** such as tutorials.
