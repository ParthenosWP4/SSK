            <desc>Research activities are usually applied to one or several research objects. An
               article about modeling of manuscript properties would therefore be tagged with the
               tags “modeling” and “manuscript”. A plain text editor would be tagged with the tags
               "writing" and "code" and "text".</desc>

               <head>Capture </head>
               <desc>"capture" generally refers to the activity of creating digital surrogates of
                  existing cultural artefacts, or expressing existing artifacts in a digital
                  representation (digitization). This could be a manual process (as in
                  "transcribing") or an automated procedure (as in "imaging" or "data_recognition").
                  Such capture precedes "enrichment" and "analysis", at least from a systematic
                  point of view, if not in practice.</desc>

                     <desc>"conversion" refers to changing the file format of an object (e.g.
                        converting a .wmv video to a .mov file as well as converting VHS into a
                        digital format) without fundamentally changing the content or nature of the
                        object. When conversion concerns metadata, it involves mapping one metadata
                        schema to another. More fundamental conversions, such as converting a
                        scanned page image to an editable text document, are better referred to
                        using “data_recognition”.</desc></item>

                     <desc>"discovering" is the activity of seeking out objects of research,
                        research results, or other information which is useful in a given search
                        perspective. Discovering includes very directed techniques such as advanced
                        querying of databases, less directed techniques such as simple "searching",
                        and more serendipitous ones as "browsing", which would include faceted
                        browsing. (It is different from "information_retrieval", which is a
                        structured way of extracting some piece of information or some specific
                        subset of objects from a resource.)</desc>

                        structured way (e.g. bringing together all papers that address a certain
                        topic, as part of a literature review, or pulling all works by a particular
                        author out of a digital collection for further analysis). Related techniques

                        formations using optical means of capture. Imaging can be made in 2D or 3D,
                        using various means (light, laser, infrared, ultrasound). Imaging usually
                        does not lead to the identification of discrete semantic or structural units
                        in the data, such as words or musical notes, which is something
                        "data_recognition" accomplishes. Imaging also includes scanning and digital
                        photography.</desc>

                     <desc>"transcription" is the activity of creating a representation of a
                        manuscript (often in combination with "enrichment") or of audio or video
                        recordings. The representation is (also) generally textual for the verbal
                        aspects of recordings and structured for example by speech turns, but can
                        also contain multimodal information like gestures or events and multimedia
                        information like time synchronization and relation to media files.
                        Transcription that is partial, selective, and/or inherently linked to the
                        source document may be better categorized as "annotation".</desc>

                  digital objects, rather than creating digital objects by capturing and digitizing
                  existing analog objects. Creating can involve writing natural language text (cf.
                  "writing") or, understood more broadly as the creation of a string of discrete
                  symbols, it could also concern other forms of expression, such as creating
                  executable code (cf. "programming"), composing a musical score, or creating an

                        testing or modeling purposes.) It is also closely related to the more
                        broader activity of tool development. Programming is separate from
                        "encoding" (enriching a document by making structural, layout-related,
                        semantic, or other information about a specific part of a document explicit

                     <desc>"annotating" refers to the activity of making information about a digital
                        object explicit by adding, e.g., comments, metadata or keywords to a
                        digitized representation or to an annotation file associated with it. This
                        can be in the form of annotations that comment on or contextualize a passage
                        (explanatory annotations) in order to make structural or linguistic
                        information explicit (structural/linguistic annotation), as linked open data
                        making the relationships between objects machine-readable, or, in the case
                        of general metadata, adding information about the object as a whole.
                        Encoding is a technique associated with annotating, as are POS-Tagging,

                        (study of text reuse / plagiarism), or textual variations between several
                        versions of one text (collation), or assessing the similarity of texts in
                        terms of stylistic features (stylometry). By analogy, such methods can also
                        be applied to other cultural artefacts, such as music, film or painting.
                        Relevant techniques include "sequence_alignment", "collation", and

                  also be considered that interpretation defines the hermeneutic perspective of any
                  method of analysis.</desc>

                        objects in a relation of geographical, temporal, or thematic proximity to
                        the object of investigation, with the aim of ascribing meaning to that
                        object. Such contextualizing may build on existing annotations and/or

                  <item><term>modeling</term>
                     <desc>"modeling" is the activity of creating an abstract representation of a
                        complex phenomenon, usually in a machine-readable way, possibly in an
                        interactive way (i.e. it includes “simulation”). Models become
                        machine-readable when modeling produces a schema that describes the elements
                        and the structure of an object of inquiry in an explicit way. Modeling can
                        also refer to the activity of transforming or manipulating a digital object
                        in such a way as to make it compatible with a previously constructed model
                        or schema. "mapping", for instance, is an example of a spatial model.
                        Workflow design is included as part of "modeling", using an object such as
                        "process".</desc></item>

                        explaining relevant phenomena or observations. Theorizing relies on
                        techniques such as "reasoning", "abstract_thinking", "conceptualizing" and
                        "defining". A theory may be implemented in the form of a model, or a model
                        may give rise to formulating a theory.</desc></item>

                        others about the object commented on. This is different from "annotating"
                        (as defined here) which refers to adding descriptive or explanatory
                        information to sections of an object with the aim of making inherent

                  activity with a research object. A case in point would be a tutorial "teaching"
                  the digital "encoding" of "music", or a report "introducing" readers to
                  "pattern_recognition" in "images". Meta-Activity tags can be added to provide
                  additional context to a typical activity+object pair of tags. In some cases,
                  however, meta-activities may also apply to objects, for example in the case of
