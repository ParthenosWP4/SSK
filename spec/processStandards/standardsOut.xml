                        interchange file format for interactive 3D applications. It is managed by
                        the nonprofit technology consortium, the Khronos Group, and has been adopted
                        by ISO as a publicly available specification, ISO/PAS 17506.&#xD;COLLADA
                        defines an open standard XML schema for exchanging digital assets among
                        various graphics software applications that might otherwise store their
                        assets in incompatible file formats. COLLADA documents that describe digital
                        assets are XML files, usually identified with a .dae (digital asset
                        exchange) filename extension.</field>
